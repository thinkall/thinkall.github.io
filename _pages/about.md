I am a senior software engineer at Microsoft, specializing in data science and AI/ML. My work involves developing and deploying automated machine learning systems, distributed deep learning/machine learning frameworks, and industry-specific AI solutions. I earned dual PhD degrees from Beijing Normal University and University Toulouse III in 2017, with my research focused on collective intelligence.
